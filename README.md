## Overview

I created this multi-sport calendar system as a comprehensive web application designed to help manage and display different sporting events across multiple sports, competitions, and seasons. It provides a backend with a modern, responsive frontend interface for viewing, filtering, and managing sports fixtures.

The system supports:
- Multiple sports (football, basketball, tennis, etc.)
- Various competitions within each sport
- Multiple seasons and phases per competition
- Team management with detailed information
- Venue tracking
- Event scheduling and status management
